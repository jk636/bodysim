# This __init__.py file can be used to gather blueprint objects
# or can be left empty if blueprints are imported directly in app.py.

# Example of how it could be used (optional):
# from .main_routes import main_bp
# from .mesh_routes import mesh_bp
# from .simulation_routes import simulation_bp
# from .property_routes import property_bp
#
# all_blueprints = [main_bp, mesh_bp, simulation_bp, property_bp]
#
# def register_all_blueprints(app):
#     for bp in all_blueprints:
#         app.register_blueprint(bp)
