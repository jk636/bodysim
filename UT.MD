# Unit Test Status and Notes (UT.MD)

This file tracks the status of unit tests and notes any particular challenges or areas that require further attention.

## General Status
- Unit test files have been created for models, utils, and routes.
- `pytest` and `pytest-mock` are listed as dependencies.
- A `conftest.py` has been added to help with Python path resolution for tests.

## Specific Test Suite Notes

### `tests/models/test_human_body.py`
- **`test_voxelize_mesh_success` Mocking:** The mock path for `voxelize_mesh` was initially `body_simulator.src.models.human_body.voxelize_mesh`. This should be `body_simulator.src.utils.mesh_utils.voxelize_mesh` if the `Organ` class correctly imports and uses the utility from `mesh_utils.py`. This will need verification when running tests. *Correction: This was noted in the previous subtask's summary and the test code itself for `test_human_body.py` was written with the corrected mock path `body_simulator.src.models.human_body.voxelize_mesh` because at that point `Organ.voxelize_mesh` called the utility function `voxelize_mesh` which was imported into `human_body.py` module as `from ..utils.mesh_utils import voxelize_mesh`. The `Organ` class's method `voxelize_mesh` then internally calls this imported `voxelize_mesh`. So the mock path should be where it's looked up: `body_simulator.src.models.human_body.voxelize_mesh`.*
  *Self-correction during planning*: The `Organ` class in `human_body.py` calls `from ..utils.mesh_utils import voxelize_mesh`. So, when testing the `Organ` class's `voxelize_mesh` method, if we want to mock the *utility function it calls*, the path to mock is indeed where it's imported *into the module under test*. So, `body_simulator.src.models.human_body.voxelize_mesh` is the correct target for mocking if the `Organ` method directly calls `voxelize_mesh` that was imported at the module level of `human_body.py`. If `Organ.voxelize_mesh` calls `self.mesh.voxelized()...`, then that's what needs mocking. The current test `test_voxelize_mesh_success` correctly mocks `body_simulator.src.models.human_body.voxelize_mesh` which implies this is the intended structure.

### `tests/utils/test_dicom_utils.py`
- No specific issues anticipated, but tests rely on correct mocking of `pydicom` and `skimage.measure` behaviors.

### `tests/utils/test_mesh_utils.py`
- No specific issues anticipated, but tests rely on correct mocking of `trimesh` and `PIL.Image` behaviors.

### `tests/test_routes.py`
- **Filesystem Interactions:** Tests involving file uploads (`UPLOAD_FOLDER`) are handled using a temporary directory created by the `client` fixture. This is good. Care must be taken that all file paths used in tests correctly point to this temporary directory.
- **DICOM Upload Test (`test_upload_dicom_success`):** This test mocks `load_dicom_volume` and `volume_to_mesh`. It correctly uses `BytesIO` for multiple file uploads. The cleanup of the temporary DICOM subdirectory created by the route itself is handled by `shutil.rmtree` within the route; the test assumes this works.
- **Visualization Tests (`test_visualize_obj_success`):** These mock `trimesh`, `pyvista`, and `send_file`. The temporary screenshot file generated by the route needs to be managed carefully; the route uses `@request.call_on_close` for cleanup, which might behave differently or not execute in a test client context without a running server. The test client fixture itself provides a temporary `UPLOAD_FOLDER`, which helps.
- **External Dependencies:** Tests assume that `pydicom`, `skimage`, `trimesh`, `pyvista`, `numpy`, `PIL` are installed or correctly mocked.

## Pending Verifications (during actual test execution)
- Ensure `PYTHONPATH` is correctly handled by `conftest.py` or pytest's discovery, allowing `from body_simulator.src...` imports.
- Verify mock paths, especially for functions imported across modules.
- Check for any unintended side effects or state leakage between tests, although using fixtures for client and temp directories should mitigate this.
- Test coverage analysis would be a valuable next step after initial test runs.
