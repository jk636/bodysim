### What This Code Does

- **Mesh loading with file existence and emptiness checks.**
- **Voxelization stub:** creates a placeholder numpy 3D grid; you should implement real voxelization.
- **Sub-organ support:** organs can contain sub-organs hierarchically.
- **Interpolate properties stub:** to calculate spatially varying physics properties.
- **Save/load human body as JSON** including organ hierarchies and properties.
- **DICOM import stub:** notes that pydicom is needed, and this will require volume segmentation + meshing.
- **Physics solver placeholder class** for future integration.
- **PyQt5 UI scaffold:** lets you select organs and edit physical properties live.

### Next Steps

- Implement real mesh voxelization (e.g., using `trimesh.voxel` or marching cubes).
- Implement mesh/volume segmentation and DICOM conversion pipeline.
- Integrate a physics solver (e.g., openEMS, MEEP) using the voxel grids.
- Add organ-specific meshes & realistic properties.
- Expand UI with visualization controls & multi-organ editing.
- Support exporting/importing more formats and configurations.




Great! Let’s tackle this step-by-step.

# 1️⃣ Simple Flask UI to upload, load, and visualize OBJ meshes

(using `trimesh` + `pyvista` backend visualization, streamed to the client)

---

# 2️⃣ Voxelization algorithm to convert meshes into 3D voxel grids

---

# 3️⃣ Basic DICOM-to-mesh pipeline skeleton using `pydicom` and `skimage.measure.marching_cubes`
